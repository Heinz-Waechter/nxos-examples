Program and manage Virtual LAN(VLAN). You can use VLANs to divide the network into separate logical areas. VLANs can also be considered as broadcast domains. Any Nexus 9000 switch port can belong to a VLAN, and unicast, broadcast, and multicast packets are forwarded and flooded only to end stations in that VLAN. Each VLAN is considered a logical network, and packets destined for stations that do not belong to the VLAN must be forwarded through a router. This section describe how you can manage and configure VLAN on a CISCO Nexus 9000 switch using different configuration management code snippet.
