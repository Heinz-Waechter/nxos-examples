Cisco provides basic traffic filtering capabilities with access control lists (also referred to as access lists). 
Access lists can be configured for all routed network protocols (IP, AppleTalk, and so on) to filter the packets of those protocols as the packets pass through a router.
A time range is created that defines specific times of the day and week in order to implement time-based ACLs.
This section configures ACL with a time range and applies it to an interface and monitor the ACL on Cisco Nexus 9000.
