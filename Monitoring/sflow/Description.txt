Sampled flow (sFlow) allows you to monitor real-time traffic in data networks that contain switches and routers. 
It uses the sampling mechanism in the sFlow agent software on switches and routers to monitor traffic and to forward the sample data to the central data collector.
This section monitors sflow statistics and sflow configuration.
